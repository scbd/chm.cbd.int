							<legend>I. INTRODUCTION</legend>
								<span class="km-help-block"> The Preliminary Reporting Framework is intended for use by Parties for providing data on resource mobilization according to the indicators adopted in decision X/3. Data provided for the 2006-2010 will be used for the calculation of a baseline while data provided after 2010 will be used to monitor progress. The relationship between each of the indicators agreed in decision X/3 and the data fields contained in the Framework is provided in Appendix 1.</span>
								<br/><br/>
							<legend>II. OVERVIEW OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORTING FRAMEWORK</legend>
								<span class="km-help-block"> The indicators in decision X/3, as well as the strategy for resource mobilization and Aichi Target 20 require certain types of information:<br/>
								<ol type="a"><li>Data, in monetary units, on flows of financial resources for biodiversity from developed to developing countries;</li>
								<li>Data, in monetary units, on financial resources available for biodiversity;</li>
								<li>Information on the steps countries are taking to implement the strategy for resource mobilization; and</li>
								<li>Information (both qualitative and quantitative, including in monetary terms) on the role of specific initiatives including those relating to technical cooperation, and innovative financial mechanisms.[1]</li></ol> 
								The Preliminary Reporting Framework has been structured to correspond with these categories. Further the framework contains a fifth section which addresses the scope of biodiversity funding. Funding for biodiversity includes not only funding for direct actions to protect biodiversity but also funding related to actions across different sectors (e.g. agriculture, forestry, tourism) to promote biodiversity-friendly initiatives that have other primary purposes (e.g. ecosystem-based approaches to climate-change mitigation and adaptation) where a wider range of funding sources is typical. In addition, economy-wide and society-wide measures that address the underlying causes of biodiversity-loss are relevant, even if they are not traditionally regarded as biodiversity finance. With this in mind, the reporting framework has been developed to distinguish two general types of biodiversity funding. Funding related to activities which are intended to directly affect biodiversity and activities which focus on other issues but which have an indirect positive effect on biodiversity. In order to facilitate comparison, ideally Parties would provide funding information according to these two categories. In order to facilitate the classification of activities, in section five, Parties have the opportunity to fine-tune this categorization according to their own needs. However the Preliminary Reporting Framework also allows respondents to provide overall totals.<br/>
								<br/>
								<i>Notes:</i>
								<br/><br/>
								[1] The indicators requiring this type of information should be completed at the discretion of Parties. Some of the data used to calculate the information required for (1) and (2) may be used to provide information for this type of indicators as well.</span>
								<br/><br/>
								<legend>III. GUIDANCE FOR THE USE OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORTING FRAMEWORK</legend>
								<span class="km-help-block"> For those sections which ask for monetary figures (1, 2, and 4):<br/>
								<ol type="a"><li>For the calculation of the baseline, please provide data for 2010 or the most recent year prior to that. If data is available for more than one year please reproduce the table and provide the information for each year. If possible, provide data for the period 2006 to 2010 and other years that may be available. If specific annual data is not available you may provide the best estimate of an average figure for a range of years (e.g. 2006-2010). For the purposes of monitoring progress please provide data for years after 2010;</li>
								<li>If your financial year does not correspond to the calendar year, please indicate the calendar year in which the financial year begins; (For example if the financial year is 1 April 2010 until 30 March 2011, please record the year as “2010”.);</li>
								<li>In order to facilitate compilation of data, please provide either: the figures in 2010 US dollars (preferred), or ensure that the currency and the relevant year are indicated;</li>
								<li>Please provide the best estimate of the data and also indicate the confidence level of your estimate (“high”: data mostly derived from published sources; “medium”: data represents expert judgment based on good information; or “low”: data is a best but risky estimate with very incomplete data). As an alternative to indicating the confidence level, you may provide a range of estimates.</li></ol> 
								In completing the reporting framework Parties are encouraged to interact with their respective statistical offices or other relevant departments when gathering information. Some of the information needed for this process is likely already available and it should be used where possible in order to reduce the reporting burden and the duplication of efforts. At the end of each question a comments field is provided where respondents can provide additional information to further substantiate responses, highlight any assumptions or qualifications linked to the data, or to raise any other related issues.<br/>
								When completing the preliminary reporting framework respondents are encouraged to provide information for as many of the data fields as possible. However, recognizing that it may be difficult for Parties to provide some of the information, there is no need to complete all of the data fields before submitting information to the Secretariat. Further, where precise information is not available, respondents are encouraged to use their best estimates.	</span>

								[2] Type of financial flows: <br/>
								<ul><li><b>Official Development Assistance (ODA)</b> refers to flows of official financing administered with the purpose of promoting economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). ODA can be bilateral or multilateral. Where resources are provided or received for general budget support rather than for specific activities, an estimate of resources provided/received for biodiversity may be calculated from the proportion of the recipient country’s budget devoted to such activities.</li>
								<li><b>Bilateral ODA</b> refers to contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries</li>
								<li><b>Multilateral ODA</b> refers to funds provided through international financial institutions such as the Global Environment Facility, the World Bank and United Nations funds and programmes.</li>
								<li><b>Other public funds</b> includes non-ODA public funding, also called “other official flows” (OOFs), which refers to transactions by the official sector with countries on the List of Aid Recipients which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as Official Development Assistance. The category also includes resources provided from other “non-donor” countries i.e. through “South-South Cooperation”.</li>
