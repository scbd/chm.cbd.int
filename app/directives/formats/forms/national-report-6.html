									This section of the sixth national report is optional but is recommended for all Parties that have developed strategies for plant conservation in response to the GSPC and/ or for Parties that have active plant conservation work taking place via networks of botanical gardens or botanical collections institutions. 
									
									For those GSPC targets that are closely aligned to specific Aichi Biodiversity Targets, information entered in the other sections of the report will be relevant here. If this is the case, the information does not need to be reproduced in its entirety in this section of the national report. Instead a reference to previous sections of the national report can be inserted. Through its Secretariat at Botanic Gardens Conservation International (bgci.org), members of the Global Partnership for Plant Conservation and other botanical institutions may be able to support Parties in compiling relevant information related to this section. 

									Using the template below, please describe your country’s contribution towards the achievement of the targets of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation. 
									This template should be replicated for each of the 16 targets of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation.

									This section of the sixth national report is intended to help complete or update the Biodiversity Country Profiles presented on the website of the Convention on Biological Diversity . Biodiversity Country Profiles provide a short overview of the status and trends of biodiversity in your country, the pressures on it and the actions taken by your country to implement the Convention and its Strategic Plan for 2011-2020 and its national biodiversity strategy and action plan. The information should present a general overview of the status and trends of biodiversity. It is not necessary to provide a detailed assessment. However, enough information should be provided to give the reader an overview of current conditions. The country profiles are displayed along with other relevant national information, including information on the country’s national focal points and their contact details as well as the country’s membership in the Protocols. If you are preparing the sixth national report with the use of the online reporting tool, your country’s current biodiversity profile will be automatically included in the template below as a starting/reference point.
									Please review and update your country’s biodiversity profile currently displayed on the clearing house mechanism. Biodiversity country profiles provide an overview of information relevant to your country’s implementation of the Convention.

							In describing progress towards this target, you may wish to consult, as relevant, with Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Some questions that your country may wish to consider responding to are: What steps have been taken since the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 was adopted to respect the knowledge, innovations, practices and customary use of biological resources? What processes or mechanisms have been put in place to promote this? How has traditional knowledge been integrated and reflected in the implementation of the Convention? Has a national focal point for Article 8(j) and related provisions been appointed? Has a national action plan to protect, preserve and promote the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities and encourage sustainable use of biodiversity been developed? Do community action plans exist? Has there been full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and/or local communities in relation to the integration of their knowledge in the implementation of the Convention? Are indigenous peoples and/or local communities, as appropriate, effectively participating in the implementation of the Convention, including in the revision/updating and implementation of NBSAPs? Have action plans or other national arrangements for the protection, preservation and promotion of indigenous and local community knowledge, innovations and practices been developed? Are systems in place for granting prior informed consent from indigenous and local communities regarding access to their knowledge, innovations and practices? Are measures in place at the national level which recognise and encourage the rights to customary sustainable use of biodiversity? What progress has been made in implementing the Plan of Action on Customary Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity, The Tkarihwaié:ri Code of Ethical Conduct to Ensure Respect for the Cultural and Intellectual Heritage of Indigenous and Local Communities, and the Akwé: Kon Voluntary Guidelines for the Conduct of Cultural, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment regarding Developments Proposed to Take Place on, or which are Likely to Impact on, Sacred Sites and on Lands and Waters Traditionally Occupied or Used by Indigenous and Local Communities?
